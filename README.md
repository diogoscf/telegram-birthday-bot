# Python Birthday Bot for Telegram

This is a bot that wishes a happy birthday on Telegram. It uses the birthdays provided in the `birthdays.json` file and supports time zones (but not daylight savings). The `birthdays.py` file allows you to generate the `birthdays.json` file from a google sheet, but you must generate a Google API key and save it in a `google_api_data.json` file, as well as provide the name of your spreadsheet.

### Dependencies
Install dependencies using pip.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
